# password-generator
This simple password generator uses all characters within "characters.txt" to generate passwords using the built-in Secrets module in Python, which is a cryptographically-secure method versus the standard "random" module.

The character list can be expanded upon with any number of additional letters and symbols, or the entire generator can become a passphrase generator by replacing the characters with words.
